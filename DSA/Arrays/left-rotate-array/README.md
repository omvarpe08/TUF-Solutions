## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer array **nums** and a non-negative integer k, rotate the array to the left by k steps.

### Example 1:

**Input:** nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], k = 2

**Output:** nums = [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]

**Explanation:**

rotate 1 step to the left: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]

rotate 2 steps to the left: [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]

### Example 2:

**Input:** nums = [3, 4, 1, 5, 3, -5], k = 8

**Output:** nums = [1, 5, 3, -5, 3, 4]

**Explanation:**

rotate 1 step to the left: [4, 1, 5, 3, -5, 3]

rotate 2 steps to the left: [1, 5, 3, -5, 3, 4]

rotate 3 steps to the left: [5, 3, -5, 3, 4, 1]

rotate 4 steps to the left: [3, -5, 3, 4, 1, 5]

rotate 5 steps to the left: [-5, 3, 4, 1, 5, 3]

rotate 6 steps to the left: [3, 4, 1, 5, 3, -5]

rotate 7 steps to the left: [4, 1, 5, 3, -5, 3]

rotate 8 steps to the left: [1, 5, 3, -5, 3, 4]

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- 0 <= k <= 10^5

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
